      <p>Ever since I was young, I have enjoyed writing and design. This is why I majored in journalism for my undergraduate degree and decided to pursue a Masters in Mass Communication with a specialization in web design. I love writing and reporting; I tend to lean more toward feature stories rather than hard news because I enjoy getting the opportunity to build relationships with my sources. I have also found that feature stories can be more moving to the reader. I also enjoy web design and graphic design, hence my pursuit of my graduate degree.</p>
      <p>Aside from those interests, I am very into nature and traveling. The beach is my favorite place to be -- specifically Honeymoon Island in Dunedin. Any time I go home to Tampa, I make time to go to Honeymoon Island. I love hiking, and one of my favorite places I've ever been is Max Patch Mountain on the border of North Carolina and Tennessee. Being there felt surreal because no one else was around and the nature was untouched. Hiking is also fun because it is exercise, and I am into working out and going to the gym. I find that nature inspires some of my other hobbies, which are drawing and listening to music. I don't draw as much as I used to, but I still try to make time. On the otherhand, I am always listening to music. My other main hobbie is watching movies. I love media that inspires me or moves me in some way, so I am always searching for a new movie to watch. </p>

      <h2 class="text-primary">Goals</h2>
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-success mb-3" onclick="window.location.href='//github.com/juliacbauer';">GitHub</button>
      <p>I always have trouble answering what my career goals are. I have found that I am very interested in multiple fields, including reporting, video storytelling (whether it be editing, filming or writing for video) and web design. I am a communications major through and through, and I have had trouble deciding what specific area of communications I want to go into. After taking a few courses toward my Masters degree, I am defintiely leaning toward something in the web design field. Coding and designing don't really feel like work to me despite the time they take.</p>
      <p>Although I am newer to the world of web design, that is my main career goal right now. However, I would also enjoy a reporting career, preferably in the magazine industry. I had an internship with WUFT where I mainly wrote feature stories, and I was also played on First at Five for a TV news package I made. The kinds of stories I like to report on are more suited for magazines. I currently intern with Irving Publications and write for Wellness360 and Giggle Magazine, and I also intern for the UF Alumni Association and write for Florida Gator Magazine. I like that the turn around for magazine stories isn't as fast as TV or print news. Magazine writing also allows me to be a bit more creative with my writing. Overall, I know I will be happy if I end up in any of those fields, but I am excited to learn more about web design and continue pursuing my Masters degree at UF.</p>
